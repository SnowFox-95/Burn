                    Burning Man is a network of people inspired by the values
                    reflected in the Ten Principles and united in the pursuit of a
                    more creative and connected existence in the world. Throughout the
                    year we work to build Black Rock City, home of the largest annual
                    Burning Man gathering, and nurture the distinctive culture
                    emerging from that experience.

                    Burning Man Project will bring experiences to people in grand,
                    awe-inspiring and joyful ways that lift the human spirit, address
                    social problems, and inspire a sense of culture, community, and
                    civic engagement. Burning Man provides infrastructural tools and
                    frameworks to support local communities in applying the Ten
                    Principles through six interconnected program areas, including
                    Arts, Civic Involvement, Culture, Education, Philosophical Center,
                    and Social Enterprise.
